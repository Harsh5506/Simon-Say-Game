#Simon Say Game
"Simon Says is a classic memory and pattern recognition game that tests players'
ability to follow sequences. The game consists of four colored buttons (red, blue,
green, and yellow) that light up in a specific order. Players must repeat the sequence 
correctly by pressing the buttons in the same order. With each correct input, the sequence 
gets longer, making the game progressively more challenging. If a player makes a mistake,
the game ends."
